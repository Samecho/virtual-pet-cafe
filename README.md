# Virtual Pet Caf√© Game

## Project Description

**What will the application do?**  
This application lets users adopt and take care of virtual pets on their computer. Each pet has stats like hunger, energy, happiness, and health that change over time. Players can feed, play, and rest their pets, and neglecting them will make their stats drop. The game will start as a console program, but I will to add a GUI later so it looks much more alive and engaging, even with animation.
